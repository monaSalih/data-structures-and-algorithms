# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
implement following methode (add,contains,get,hash) in hash table class
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* add:
      - time : O(1)
      - space: O(1)
* contains:
      - time : O(n)
      - space: O(1)
* get:
      - time : O(n)
      - space: O(1)
* hash:
      - time : O(n)
      - space: O(1)
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
* add:
A method for adding a new value to the map This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table.

* contains:
check if the key exist in the tan=ble or not

* get:
Retrieve the most recent value of in oour hasmap for the given key

* hash:
Takes a key which is a string and returns an integer which is the index that will be used to store the key/value pari in a Node at that index.
