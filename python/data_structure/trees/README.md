## Challenge
* Creat Node class to store value in the node for left and right childe
* Binary Tree :
- Create binary class
- define method for depth first search
- create method for following:
    1- pre order
    2- in order
    3- post order

* Create Binary searcg tree:
- creat subClass of binary tree class
- creat add method to add item to Binary searcg tree
- creat contains method to check if the item exist or not

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Binary search
- pre order :time O(n)  spaceO(n)
- in order:time O(n)  spaceO(n)
- post order:time O(n)  spaceO(n)

* Binary searcg tree
- add :time O(n)  spaceO(n)
- contains :time O(n)  spaceO(n)
