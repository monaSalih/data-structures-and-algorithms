Efficiency:O(n)
space:O(1)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

-[x] creat new method call it  bfs

-[x]  create instanse from class Queue

-[x] add root node

-[x] do while loop to check there is no nood in queue

-[x] if there node do dequeue for it and store it in list

-[x] do recarcine to check if there is node in left side or right side
