## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
in this code challange create new method accept two list in order to zipped them in one list ,following space and time efficiency
efficiency=>O(n)
space=>O(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

i used python poetry shell to navigat the test also use python note bad test to test the real result
