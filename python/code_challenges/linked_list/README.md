Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

* [pull_request_link](https://github.com/monaSalih/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/linked-list/python/code_challenges/linked_list)to go to the linked list


## Challenge
Methods

* append
```
arguments: new value
this method do the following:
>adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
>add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
```

* insert before
```
arguments: value, new value
this method do the following:
> Before the middle list add new node
> Before the the head
```

* insert after
```
arguments: value, new value
this method do the following:
>adds a new node  after a node in the middle
>insert a node after the last node of the linked list

```
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
in my case it will take o(n^2)
