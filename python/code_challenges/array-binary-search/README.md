Write a function called **BinarySearch** which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

the output of the two input should be the return the index of the array’s element that is equal to:

## Approach & Efficiency
time=>O(n)
where i use one loop
